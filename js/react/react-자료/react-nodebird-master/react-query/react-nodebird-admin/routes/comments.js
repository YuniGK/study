// This file contains the logic of every route in Forest Admin for the collection comments:
// - Native routes are already generated but can be extended/overriden - Learn how to extend a route here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v6/reference-guide/routes/extend-a-route
// - Smart action routes will need to be added as you create new Smart Actions - Learn how to create a Smart Action here: https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/v6/reference-guide/actions/create-and-manage-smart-actions
